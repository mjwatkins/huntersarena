Hunters Arena is a demonstration python project.  It is a text based rpg.

This game allows you to progress 1 character through 10 rounds of combat. In order to 
clear each round, you must defeat at least 5 enemies. You can however fight as many as
many as you like. This allows you to gain experience and increase your statistics.

Stats
* Strength: Influences damage at all times
* Speed: Increases chance of hitting or making opponents miss
* Constitution: Increases maximum hp
* Skill: increases chance to hit or making opponents miss (lesser impact, but less random). Sometimes skill allows you to detect how injured your opponent is.

Also, stronger enemies drop  powerful weapons and armors on occaision.
* Armors increase in strength based on the enemy that dropped it
* Weapon increase in strength based on the enemy that dropped it and the damage done by that weapon is impacted by its "trait".  All weapons do more damage in the hands of a strong user, but, the trait of the weapon does additional damage based on the "trait".   So, for example, some weapons add both Speed and Strength to their damage.  The name of the object should provide a hint to the trait.
